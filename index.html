            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is used in a lot of programs today and is something that most people probably do not know that they probably have already used this feature before. In it's most basic definition form, you can say its the undo button of methods. Similar to the undo button in Microsoft Word, Version Control is the system behind a feature such as that. Web designers such as ourselves, need to utilize and familiarize ourselves with these systems to help make errors a breeze, by just reverting to a saved state where the file worked properly, and more. Version Control systems can be local, centralized, or distributed. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With the readings, I chose this topic specifically because learning the background and history of subjects or material, helps people understand the material even more and is also something that is interesting to see from where it all started to where it is now. Git started off in Linux as a system called BitKeeper, and what they were doing at the time was something precedented and something that was a great tool, but was not 100% there to its full capacity of what it was capable of. When BitKeeper went down in 2005, the need to develop something similar brew out and that's when Git was created and was able to do more than the original program was. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Basics of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To understand Git, you need to be open-minded to the way the program acts and does things because of the subtle differences this program carries compared to other VCSs. What other programs like Git do is store different files, whereas Git will make a sort of basically screenshots of the files to store the data. Another difference is how most of the operations under Git are local, where other VCSs would need to be connected to the network and can experience latency. Git being offline means it can be worked with anywhere with no need of the internet, even while being on an airplane. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How to get a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">This topic from the beginning was not only interesting, but it was also necessary to understand how to use Git and their repositories. At the beginning of the chapter, they even state the importance of this chapter alone. The two ways to make a Git repository would be by essentially converting a local directory into a Git repository, or cloning the files of an already made Git repository. The process of doing both involves a set of commands performed in a method that executes the functions. When doing this, it's good to know the commands or have them readily available by searching for them and inputting them into your terminal. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Getting started is not hard, as long as you follow the steps. Making an account is as easy as making one for any other online service you have ever signed up for, such as social media websites. The only part that is intimidating is the process of getting the SSH key and going through the steps of making a repository into your workspace (like what I did for this lesson!). GitHub makes it easy and user-friendly and when you've got the steps with you, it's a whole lot easier. Other account features can be made like any other service, such as changing your avatar or enabling two-factor authentication, which is a feature you should always take advantage of for every service that has it.</p>
